                <p>Sometimes while writing code, errors occur, we sit with our hands on our heads. Don't know what to do now. Sometimes everything gets fixed by itself. We then think that - how it was fixed by itself!</p>

                <h3>First thing fisrt priority</h3>
                <p>The first priority is to use GitHub well. Whenever we finish writing some code, we should immediately push the code to GitHub via command. If you leave it for later, it can cause difficulties for beginners.</p>

                <h3>Never do that again</h3>
                <p>In our rush to publish a live site, we often forget to push the last code. As a result, the default site we work with is complete, but the live site lags behind. So all the details should be checked very well so that such unwanted mistakes do not happen.</p>
